# Description
Social Network API is an API built for a social network web application where users can share there thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and add and remove friends. This app was built using Express.js, a MongoDb database, and the Mongoose ODM. A live recording of testing out the various API endpoints of the application in Insomnia core can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JdLcvaDnESzMtrS8SkIwFyxnawkC69Dm/view).
